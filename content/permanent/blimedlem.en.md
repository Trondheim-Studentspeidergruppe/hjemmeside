We're always looking for new members, our favorite motto is

> The more, the merrier!

If you want to join us for Thursday meetings and cabin trips in the weekends,
you just have to let us know and show up.

If you want to become a full member to get voting rights for our general
assembly and decide on our direction, you can do this by paying a yearly
membership due.

- The yearly membership due is 150,-
- It can be paid by Vipps to the Vipps-number: `562633`.
  - Or you can search for "TSSG".
- It can also be paid by bank transaction to `4202 21 73000`.

Should this be inconvenient for you, talk to us and we'll figure something out.
