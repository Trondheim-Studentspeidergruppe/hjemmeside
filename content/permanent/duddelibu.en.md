## About Duddelibu

Like a real scouting group, we've got our own cabin: our dear Duddelibu!
Duddelibu is located on Selbuhøgda, some miles southeast of Trondheim.
The cabin was built by TSSG'ers in 1964, and since then it has been well in use.
Some people have even spent a year in total on Duddelibu!

The hiking terrain around Duddelibu is terrific whether you'd like a small trip or a long hike.
There's something for every taste!
The snow thaws slowly on Duddelibu, so it's possible to go skiing more than half of the year!

Other parts of the Duddelibu "package" is the sauna "Badelibu" and the privy called "The Memorial to the Widow Moe".
After a round in the sauna it's time for a bath in the officially approved swimming area "Kurbadet", which is a 1 x 1.5 meter hole in the bog.

Every year, around the 16th of February the birthday of the cabin is celebrated with a great big cake and dinner made by the board.

## Where's the cabin?

The cabin is located at the Height between Hommelvik and Selbustrand.
If you go from Hommelvik, drive upwards and past Mostadmark to about 200 meters before the road descends to Selbusjøen.
There's a parking lot on the righthand side, here is where you can park.
The cabin is across the bog on the righthand side of the road.
Go across the bog or follow the gravel path towards some cabins.
Especially, there's a rather large cabin which might serve as a landmark.
Go past this large cabin and down the hill behind it.
Duddelibu is about 40 meters down the hill.

If none of the above made any sense, we have GPS-coordinated: 63° 16.958′ N, 10° 54.283′ Ø

The cabin also has a location on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Duddelibu/@63.2766037,10.9887312,56180m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sduddelibu!3m6!1s0x466d19000f80b0b5:0x88382045b2a6b903!8m2!3d63.2826636!4d10.9046015!15sCglkdWRkZWxpYnWSAQtzcG9ydHNfY2x1YuABAA!16s%2Fg%2F11w8kcf8r_?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)

## How to get to the Height?

A bus route used to go past the cabin.
This is no longer the case as it was closed in 2013, and we're now dependent on car or Taxi.

On school days there's a bus route from Hommelvik to Sneisen (about 8 km north of Duddelibu, "skolerute 385").
From Trondheim it's about 40 km by bicycle.
It is possible to cycle from Hommelvik or via Jonsvannet and over to "Bakken".
