Information about renting the cabin can be found [here]({{< ref "permanent/leiedb" >}} "Renting Duddelibu").

Like a real scouting group, we've got our own cabin: our dear Duddelibu!
Duddelibu is located on Selbuh√∏gda, some miles southeast of Trondheim.
The cabin was built by TSSG'ers in 1964, and since then it has been well in use.
Some people have even spent a year in total on Duddelibu!

The hiking terrain around Duddelibu is terrific whether you'd like a small trip or a long hike.
There's something for every taste!
The snow thaws slowly on Duddelibu, so it's possible to go skiing more than half of the year!

Other parts of the Duddelibu "package" is the sauna "Badelibu" and the privy called "The Memorial to the Widow Moe".
After a round in the sauna it's time for a bath in the officially approved swimming area "Kurbadet", which is a 1 x 1.5 meter hole in the bog.

Every year, around the 16th of February the birthday of the cabin is celebrated with a great big cake and dinner made by the board.
