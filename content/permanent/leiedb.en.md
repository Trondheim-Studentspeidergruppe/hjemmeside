## Renting prices

| | Member (TSSG) | Member (scouting group) | Not member |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| Per night: | 0,- | 75,- | 125,- |
| Minimum per weekend: | 0,- | 900,- | 1000,- |
| Minimum per night (weekdays): | 0,- | 450,- | 500,- |

The renting price is calculated based on the number of nights stayed on the cabin.

**Example 1**: Ten non-members rent the cabin for a weekend (two nights).
The renting price is then 10 (persons) x 2 (nights) x 75,- (price per non-member) = 1500,-.

**Example 2**: Three non-members rent the cabin for a weekend (two nights).
The renting price is then 3 (persons) x 2 (nights) x 125,- (price per non-member) = 750,-.
However, 750,- is less than 1000,-, and the final renting price is 1000,-.

Keys can be obtained from the Kæbbinbåss before the renting period.
It is to be returned immediately after the trip is completed accompanying a signed status report.

If something is missing or broken before departure, tell the Kæbbinbåss.
Rentees are primarily responsible for replacing and compensating, but this will be directly discussed in each case.
