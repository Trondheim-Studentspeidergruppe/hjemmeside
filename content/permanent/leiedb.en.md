Duddelibu is the cabin belonging to TSSG.
It's located at Selbuhøgda some miles southeast of Trondheim.
The cabin can be rented by student groups, scouting groups and other organisations.

* There are 22 sleeping spots.
* We have solar panels which power indoor lighting.
* The woodfired fireplace serves as indoor heating
* Drinking water can be fetched from the well.
* The kitchen is gas fired and contains utensils,* pots, pans, bowls, cups, plates and other things.

## Renting prices

| | Member (TSSG) | Member (scouting group) | Not member |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| Per night: | 0,- | 75,- | 125,- |
| Minimum per weekend: | 0,- | 900,- | 1000,- |
| Minimum per night (weekdays): | 0,- | 450,- | 500,- |

The renting price is calculated based on the number of nights stayed on the cabin.

Payment is done either via Vipps or invoice.
Number for Vipps is: 557359 (Duddelibu, TSSG), and payment should be sent within a week after the end of the stay.
Invoice should be paid within two weeks after it has been sent.
Mark the payment with name of the renter and the renting period, this goes for both Vipps and invoice.

**Price example 1**: Ten non-members rent the cabin for a weekend (two nights).
The renting price is then 10 (persons) x 2 (nights) x 75,- (price per non-member) = 1500,-.

**Price example 2**: Three non-members rent the cabin for a weekend (two nights).
The renting price is then 3 (persons) x 2 (nights) x 125,- (price per non-member) = 750,-.
However, 750,- is less than 1000,-, and the final renting price is 1000,-.

Keys can be obtained from the Kæbbinbåss before the renting period.
It is to be returned immediately after the trip is completed accompanying a signed status report.

If something is missing or broken before departure, tell the Kæbbinbåss.
Rentees are primarily responsible for replacing and compensating, but this will be directly discussed in each case.

## Where's the cabin?

The cabin is located at the Height between Hommelvik and Selbustrand.
If you go from Hommelvik, drive upwards and past Mostadmark to about 200 meters before the road descends to Selbusjøen.
There's a parking lot on the righthand side, here is where you can park.
The cabin is across the bog on the righthand side of the road.
Go across the bog or follow the gravel path towards some cabins.
Especially, there's a rather large cabin which might serve as a landmark.
Go past this large cabin and down the hill behind it.
Duddelibu is about 40 meters down the hill.

If none of the above made any sense, we have GPS-coordinated: 63° 16.958′ N, 10° 54.283′ Ø

The cabin also has a location on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Duddelibu/@63.2766037,10.9887312,56180m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sduddelibu!3m6!1s0x466d19000f80b0b5:0x88382045b2a6b903!8m2!3d63.2826636!4d10.9046015!15sCglkdWRkZWxpYnWSAQtzcG9ydHNfY2x1YuABAA!16s%2Fg%2F11w8kcf8r_?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)

Here's a list of useful things to pack for a trip to Duddelibu if you're renting:

* Indoor shoes
* Sanitary effects
* Swimwear and a towel (if you plan to use the sauna)

## Practical information

> Kæbbinbåss (cabin chief): Bjørnar Kaarevik
> (Contact: 473 76 240, bjornar@tssg.no)
> Cabin coordinates: 63° 16.958’ N, 10° 54.283’ E

**Heating:**
We have a nice soapstone oven for heating.
Fire carefully the first half hour to let the oven heat up slowly.
Do not overfill it with wood.
It takes a long time to fully heat the oven up, but this means it also keeps warm for longer.
Use dry firewood from the storage inside. Ash may be disposed of behind the privy.

**Gas and lighting:**
We have generation of electricity by solar panels, and most of the cabin should have electric lights.
The power is turned on by pressing the button labeled ”Hovedbryter AV/PÅ”on the regulator in the attic.
This button is the main breaker.
If arrows are pointing from the battery to the light bulb on the display, the power is on.
Please conserve electricity as much as possible and turn off lights that are not needed.
There is gas for the gas fired stove in the tool shed which must be connected on arrival.
Remember to turn off and disconnect the gas before departure!
In the annex, oil lamps or temporary lighting must be used.
Kerosene for the lamps can be found in a small white or big red container in the tool shed.

**Drinking water:**
We have a well with drinking water some tens of meters from the cabin, in the facing direction when standing in the doorway out.
Use the metal buckets placed by the oven.
(There are only for drinking water.)
The well freezes during winter, but this is solved by cracking the ice on top.
The well house must sometimes be dug out of the snow.

**Food:**
Spices and sugar in the kitchen may be used at your leisure.
Do not use any other food in the cabin.
Tea and coffee kettles are marked with labels.
Do not leave any food in the cabin.
The top cupboard in the shed is mouse tight.
Hang all food which does not fit in the cupboard up above ground so the mice cannot reach it.

**Beds and indoors:**
shoes You must bring sleeping bags or something equivalent.
The cabin has mattresses and pillows.
Slippers are highly recommended.

**Bonfires:**
Bonfires may only be lit in the approved location behind the cabin.
You may only light bonfires with your own firewood.
If bonfires are lit with firewood from the cabin, or in other places then the approved location, a 2000 kr fine will incur.

**Privy and water-letting:**
The privy is located downhill from the cabin.
Those with sufficient plumbing can make use of the well signposted secondary area when nature calls only lightly.

**Sauna and Spa:**
The sauna is wood fired, so be careful.
A clever trick is to place a big pot of water on the oven in the sauna so you can use the water for cleaning later.
Do not bring plastic buckets or other things prone to melting into the sauna.
The Spa (Kurbadet) is in the bog behind the cabin.
Remember to place the lid back on after using the Spa.

**Tables:**
The tables can be joined together forming a long table.
If there is no bench under the window, there is an extra bench plate in the attic.
The smallest table can be raised so it is as tall as the dining table.

**Kitchen towels:**
These can be found in the rightmost drawer in the kitchen.
Dirty towels must be taken back home, cleaned and returned to the Kæbbinbåss together with the keys after the trip.

**Fire alarm:**
There is a fire alarm on the roof in the attic.
Check that the batteries are slotted in and that they work.

**Waste:**
Waste can be disposed of in some containers off the main road.
Drive further away from Hommelvik (turn right out of the parking lot) and take the first turn to the left, up a hill.
Alternatively, they may be brought back to the city.

**Notice!:**
Duddelibu is a privately owned cabin, not a Koie.
We hope you remember this when the party goes on deep into the night...
When you leave, the cabin should look as it did when you arrived.
Broken items must be replaces and extra clean up after the stay will incur extra costs on the renter (500 kr per started hour).
